## ðŸš¨ The Problem
 - The high taxation on rental profits presents a significant challenge for landlords and tenants alike.
Elevated tax rates diminish property owners' net gains, discouraging investments in rental properties and affecting housing availability.
Tenants, in turn, may face higher rents due to the tax burdens imposed on landlords. This can result in economic hardships for tenants,
especially in areas with a heated real estate market. Furthermore, excessive taxation can harm the overall economy by discouraging activity
 in the real estate sector and reducing potential for economic growth. Therefore, striving for a fair balance between taxation and
incentivizing investment in the rental market is essential to promote a healthy and accessible real estate market.

### Auction Economic Justification
- **Without Housy** : <br>
When a real estate agency rents real estate, the income generated by the rentals is considered taxable income for the legal entity. This income will be taxed according to the Corporate Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Income (CSLL) rates, which together can vary from 15% to 34%, depending on the type of company and the amount of profit. Additionally, the company needs to consider other related tax obligations, such as the Social Integration Program (PIS) and the Contribution for the Financing of Social Security (COFINS).
- **With Housy**: <br>
However, if a real estate company uses Housy to receive its rents, this operation will be taxed in accordance with the capital gains taxation rules. In this case, the Income Tax rate is 15% on the profit obtained in the operation.
- **Transparency and Credibility**: <br>
  Auctions provide a transparent and public process for asset sales. This can enhance the credibility of the Housy platform and foster trust among investors and buyers. The transparency in the auction process, coupled with the underlying blockchain technology, can offer an immutable record of all transactions, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the asset's history.
- **Maximization of Value**:<br> Competitive auctions can lead to the maximization of the value of the auctioned asset. Competition among buyers can drive up bids and, consequently, increase the final price achieved for the asset. This can be particularly advantageous for sellers on the Housy platform.
